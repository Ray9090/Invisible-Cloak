# Invisible-Cloak using OpenCV | Python Project | Computer Vision

Have you ever seen Harry Potter’s Invisible Cloak; Was it wonderful? Have you ever wanted to wear that cloak? If Yes!! then in this project, I have buiul the same cloak which Harry Potter uses to become invisible. Yes, I am not building it in a real way but it is all about graphics trickery.

Why Red?
Sure, I could have used green, isn’t Red the magician’s color? Jokes aside, colors like green or blue will also work fine with a little bit of changes in code.

Algorithm:

1. Capture and store the background frame 
2. Detect the red colored cloth using color detection and segmentation algorithm.
3. Segment out the red colored cloth by generating a mask.
